        <p>
            My name is Alexander J. Brittain, and I am currently majoring in artificial intelligence at the University
            of Advancing Technology. I have decided to change my career path after many years working in other
            occupations for many reasons. It has been an iteresting process learning a whole new professional skill, and
            returning to being a student in college again.
        </p>

        <p>
            This webpage is a place where I can keep track of what I have learned so that I can remember it myself, and
            others can see my progress as well. I hope you enjoy your stay!
        </p>
