        <h2>Personal stuff that only I probably care about.</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Washington state. I played sports through my childhood and all the way through my
            years in school. I originally began studying in sports medicine, since I was so passionate about physical
            health for myself. I attened one year of university classes only to find out that I wasn't as driven to be
            successful in that field as I thought. I worked in restaurants for over 10 years and have experience in
            almost every position that was available to work. I researched other things in my spare time hoping to find
            something that would spark my interests enough to return to school. I applied at the University of Advancing
            Technology and was recommended to take the AI courses they offer. So now here I am, and I am excited to
            continue
            this adventure!</p>
